# Web Accessibility
Using Google's integrated [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) analysis, I found that a meta description tag was required to meet best SEO practices. Using [WAVE's](https://wave.webaim.org) web accessibility evaluation tools, I also found that I was missing a neccessary label for the contact body. Since I thought the placeholder text was descriptive enough, I decided to add an aria-label and title property to the marked textarea tag.
